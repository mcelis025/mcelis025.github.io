                            Hello! Welcome to Coding Portfolio! Here I will show the work I have done and by doing so you will be able to see what I can bring to the table.
                            I am an Active Duty military member looking to transition into the technology industry. My current job title is Document Controller.
                            The job duties consit of:
                            <br><br>
                            Inspect documentation to ensure accuracy and reliablility.<br>
                            Check authorizations to certify the only authorized personnel access records.<br>
                            Communicate errors through prsoper channels to ensure corrections are made.</br>
                            Organize and maintain a fileplan to ensure records are accessible.<br>
                            Ensure audit readiness of fileplan and its contents.<br>
                        <br>
                            My favorite thing to do in my current position is to solving issues that arise. I am able to use my critial thinking skills and work towards a solution. 
                            The pride I have towards my work has allowed me to be recognized among my peers and be rewarded with the title of Airman of the Quarter. 
                            The passion I show at work I also show in my personal life. With a great deal of hard work and dedication I was able to obtain a Bachelor's of Science in Criminal Justice. 
                        <br>
                            As a transitioning military member I am looking for a career that will permit me to use my skills. My hard work and dedication will allow me to succeed in this challenging industry.
